Given the initial state of a board and a series of operations, output the final state of the board
(the position of all ships and whether it has sunk or not). The input should be a file and the
output stored in another file.
The first line contains the size of the board. The second line contains a list of
coordinate-and-orientation tuples (initial position of the ships). Any subsequent lines are
operations: shoot operations (simply coordinates) and move operations (coordinates to specify
the ship to be considered and a sequence of 'L' (rotate left), 'R' (rotate right) and 'M' (move)).

** EXAMPLE **
Input:
  10                      // Size of the board is 10x10
  (0, 0, N) (9, 2, E)     // 2 ships in different locations
  (0, 0) MRMLMM           // move/rotate the ship located at (0, 0)
  (9, 2)                  // shoot at (9, 2) and sink the ship if there is one

Output:
  (1, 3, N)
  (9, 2, E) SUNK
  

The output will be displayed on output.txt
